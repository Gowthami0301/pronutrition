## Learning Goals

In this exercise, the goal is to apply as many as possible of the concepts you've just learned:

- props and state in react,
- event handling in react.

## Getting started

In the end of this document, you will find guidelines on how to submit the exercise.

### Introduction

You just realized that since the beginning of the bootcamp, your diet is not healthy and it may have an impact on your health (and productivity), now and in the long term.

To take care of the food you eat, you decided to create a nutrition app that will track everything you eat!

So let's get started!

### Progression 1 | Create `FoodBox` component

Create a `FoodBox` component that takes at least `food` as a prop and displays a box with all the information about an ingredient.


### Progression 2 | Display food

In your `App` component (your main component), display as many `FoodBox` as elements inside the variable `foods`.


### Progression 3 | Implement search bar

Create a `Search` component to perform a search that updates the list of all meal.


### Progression 4 | Create add buttons

On your `FoodBox`, you have an input an "+" button. Use them so that when a user clicks on the button, it adds them on a list on the right called "_Today's foods_".

You will also need to display the total amount of calories at the bottom of the list as a recap.


### Progression 5 | Bonus | Group ingredients

You made an awesome application, but you have found a little problem in the UX. For example, if you click twice on "_Apple_", it will display 2 lines "_1 Apple = 400 cal_" instead of 1 line "_2 Apple = 800 cal_". Fix that problem.

### Progression 6 | Bonus | Allow the user to remove an ingredient

On the "_Today's food_", add a trash icon to let users removing one of their items.

Happy coding! :heart:
